<br />

👋 I'm **Ari**, a fellow developer located in Australia currently working on [Lunatic, an Erlang-inspired runtime for WebAssembly](https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic).

Previously, I've worked for some companies involved with web development & crypto, and now am developing my own projects as self employed.

- 🌑 I’m currently working with [Lunatic Solutions](https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic), notably on the web framework [submillisecond](https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/submillisecond).
- 🐦 I've recently enjoyed working with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), and participating in both game jams.
- 🥷 A project I'm proud of is [Thalo](https://github.com/thalo-rs/thalo), a Rust crate built for event sourcing.
- 🦀 I'm a Rustacean, passionate about evolving the Rust ecosystem and excited about the future of WebAssembly & WASI.
- 👯 I’m open to collaborate, feel free to get in touch.
