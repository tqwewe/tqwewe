<br />

👋 I'm **Ari**, a fellow developer currently traveling. ✈️ My office has been a cafe in Jakarta.

Previously, I've worked for some companies involved with web development & crypto, and now am developing my own projects as self employed.

- 🥷 I’m currently working on [Thalo](https://github.com/thalo-rs/thalo) and tools build around event sourcing.
- 🦀 I'm a Rustacean, passionate about evolving the Rust ecosystem and excited about the future of WebAssembly & WASI.
- 👯 I’m open to collaborate, feel free to get in touch.
